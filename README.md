# Work Day Scheduler

The path I took for this project was a rugged one from start to finish. The criteria for this assignment required me to create a web application that showed the user a list of the workday hours, and allowed the user to apply schedules/tasks to each hour. From there, the website was then supposed to save those tasks to local storage, so that when the page was refreshed the tasks stayed in their places. In addition to all this, the tasks themselves needed to change color depending on how close/far they got to present time. 

All that being said, I set out to tackle this project first by cloning the starter code that was provided. Out of curiosity, instead of cloning the code to a new repository, I just forked it from the original starter code. I say this, just incase there is any confusion about the .gitignore's most recent commit. After forking the code, I wanted to start with one of the first tasks in the criteria. Which was to display the current date when the application is opened. I achieved this with a simple function which uses moment.js to find the current month, day, and year. I then passed that variable into the text of the HTML element to display it at the top of the page. After that was done, I set out to create the time-blocks/individual hours of the work day, and the textareas/save buttons that coorelated with the hours. I got the time-blocks to display properly using a function called timeBlock, which started by using a variable to calculate and store the first hour I want to start counting from. For this, I wanted to have the time-blocks show 3 hours past and up until midnight of the current day. I chose this route because I know that for some people the work day runs all the way to the end of the day, and I didn't want to limit it to standard work hours. That being said, after using that startTime to calculate 3 hours before current time, I did this in 24 hour time so that it would be easier to calculate in a the for loop. I then parsed the time value and passed it into the for loop. At the start of the for loop the number is checked to see if it is less than/equal to 24, and if so, the number increases by one, then moves through a sequence of variables which set the data for each timeBlock. Starting with turning the parsed value back into a string, then into 12hour time so that AM and PM would be displayed. With the last variables creating div, p, and textarea tags with certain classes/id's and appending them to their respective elements. At this point, I had put so much time into setting up the current code, and making it work, that I was running short on time, and needed to get started on the next assignment. That being the case, I attempted a function that would save my task values to local storage, and return them when the page is reload. However, that is when I realized the fault in my code. Rather than creating all the elements within an object, and saving each object to an array. I created them all separately, making it way more complex than it should be. So I decided to just submit what I have, and move on with my life. My intention is to fix it should I get some free time to work on it. In which case, I will adjust the function to push all the created elements data to an array, and set/get that object from local storage. Then go on to make things aesthetically pleasing. By adding the colors which signify the urgency of the task based on its due dates relation to present time.
